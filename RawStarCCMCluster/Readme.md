# Run Star-CCM+ in an Azure HPC Cluster

With this template, you can quickly set up and benchmark a high-performance
computing (HPC) cluster in the Microsoft Azure environment as a proof of concept
for running Star-CCM+ version 11.02.010-R8 from CD-adapco, a Siemens Business.
This template creates the cluster, provides benchmarking options, and installs
the Star-CCM+ simulation software so you can test its 
[performance on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/availability-of-star-ccm-on-microsoft-azure/?v=17.23h).

> **NOTE:** To use this template, you must have a valid Power-on-Demand (POD) license
> for Star-CCM+. For details, see the Licensing section later in this article.
> Your Azure subscription must also have a sufficient quota to run this workload,
> which requires A8-A9 or H-Series virtual machines (VMs).

## Architecture

This template creates a simple architecture you can use to demonstrate Star-CCM+
running in a high-performance cluster based on virtual machine scale sets. This
architecture is intended for test purposes.

Scale sets make it quick to deploy this cluster. A scale set is an Azure compute
resource you can use to deploy and manage a collection of identical VMs as a
set. Scale sets support autoscaling, making them well suited for building
large-scale services targeting big compute and big data workloads.

You use an [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) 
(ARM) template to deploy the cluster shown in the following figure.


![](https://github.com/tanewill/5clickTemplates/blob/master/images/hpc_star-ccm-architecture.png "High-performance cluster for running Star-CCM+ in Azure.")
Figure 1. High-performance cluster for running Star-CCM+ in Azure.

After downloading and configuring Star-CCM+, the template authenticates all the
nodes in the cluster and creates a common share directory used by each node. One
VM is designated as the jumpbox and head node. A network interface (NIC) is
added to the jumpbox, which is placed in a virtual network together with the
scale set. A public IP is assigned to the jumpbox NIC and port 22 is left open
for SSH.

To access the jumpbox, use the following command:

```
   ssh {username}\@{vm-public-ip-address}
```

## Storage

For this architecture, the template creates four [storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-create-storage-account)
for the scale set and one for the jumpbox. The following NFS file shares are
created:

-   **/mnt/nfsshare** is created from the head node's operating system disk and
    shared with the scale set nodes.

-   **/mnt/resource/scratch** is created on the temp disk of the head node. The
    temp disk is a physically attached disk that typically provides faster
    performance on each of the nodes. If the jumpbox is deallocated, the data in
    this directory will be lost.

This template does not take advantage of Azure Managed Disks to manage the
storage accounts associated with the VM disks. We plan to add this feature in a
future update of this template.

## Authentication

To support the NFS share and the tools used to set up authentication, several
packages are installed during deployment. During the authentication phase, the
**nodenames.txt** and **nodeips.txt** files are placed in **\~/bin**. These
files contain the names and IP addresses of the nodes in the scale set. A copy
of **nodenames.txt** is placed in **/mnt/resource/hosts**.

The VMs that are part of the scale set, which is inside a private network, are
accessible only from the jumpbox by using a private IP address. To access one of
these nodes from the jumpbox, use the following command in an SSH client:

```
   ssh {username}\@{vm-private-ip-address}
```

## Star-CCM+

During deployment, you select the model of benchmark you want to use, and this
model is installed along with Star-CCM+ version 11.02.010-R8. The application is
installed in the **/mnt/resource/scratch/applications/** directory, and a path
to the binary is added to **\~.bashrc**. The benchmark model is unpacked in the
jumpbox’s **/mnt/resource/scratch/benchmark** directory.

The **runAndRecord.java** file contains the scripting commands for Star-CCM+. To
run a benchmark, issue the following command, where {podkey} is your license and
{filename.sim} is the name of the Star-CCM+ simulation you want to run.

```
    time(Star-CCM+ -np 80 -machinefile ../hosts -power -podkey {podkey} -rsh ssh
    -mpi intel -cpubind bandwidth,v -mppflags " -ppn 8 -genv
    I\_MPI\_DAPL\_PROVIDER=ofa-v2-ib0 -genv I\_MPI\_DAPL\_UD=0 -genv
    I\_MPI\_DYNAMIC\_CONNECTION=0 -genv I\_MPI\_FABRICS=shm:dapl" -batch
    /mnt/resource/scratch/benchmark/runAndRecord.java
    /mnt/resource/scratch/benchmark/{filename.sim)
```

## Licensing

During deployment, you are asked for the POD key associated with your Star-CCM+
license.

-   **If you’re using this template to demonstrate Star-CCM+ for sales
    purposes**, before deployment, you can add your customer’s POD key as a
    parameter in the **azuredeploy.parameters** file.

-   **If you work for Microsoft**, you can [sign up to receive an existing POD key](https://aka.ms/cd-adapco)
    for benchmarking, performance testing, and other non-sales related activities.

# Deploy the ARM template

1.  Right-click **Deploy to Azure** shown below and select either **Open link in
    new tab** or **Open link in new window**.

1.  In the Azure portal, enter values for the following settings:

    1.  For **Resource group**, select **Create New** and type a name for the
        [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups)
        associated with this template’s deployment.

    2.  For **Location** box, select a region.

    3.  For **Resource Location**, select a region where HPC is available. The
        resources will be deployed to this region. For the latest information,
        see [Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/).

    4.  For **Vm Sku**, choose the VM size that works in your region, such as
        **H16r** or **H16mr**.

    5.  For **Vmss Name**, enter a base name of 3 to 10 characters used in
        naming resources. The name must be unique across Azure. For some
        resources, a hash is prefixed to this name. Other resource-specific
        information is appended to this name.

    6.  For **Instance Count**, choose the number of VMs you want. To see if you
        have the quota for the quantity you choose, see how to 
        [check core and storage usage](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/madan/2016/10/25/check-azure-resource-manager-arm-vm-core-storage-usage-using-powershell/)
        using PowerShell.

        to use for the administrator account, which applies to all the VMs.

    8.  In the **POD Key** box, enter your product license.

    9.  For **Download Model**, select the benchmark model you want to use.

    10. Review the terms and conditions, then click the **I agree to the terms
        and conditions stated above** checkbox.

    11. Click the **Purchase** button, then wait for the deployment to finish,
        which may take some time depending on the VM sizes selected. The
        deployment status is shown under **Notifications**.

2.  In Azure portal, navigate to the resource group where this was deployed,
    click the **Public IP** resource, copy the IP address, then log on to the
    VM.

3.  Navigate to **/mnt/resource/scratch/benchmark**.

4.  To run **Star-CCM+**, use the following command, substituting your POD key
    number and the name of the .sim file you want to run. In this code sample,
    **np 80** is the number of cores to run on.
```
    time(Star-CCM+ -np 80 -machinefile ../hosts -power -podkey {podkey} -rsh ssh
    -mpi intel -cpubind bandwidth,v -mppflags " -ppn 8 -genv
    I\_MPI\_DAPL\_PROVIDER=ofa-v2-ib0 -genv I\_MPI\_DAPL\_UD=0 -genv
    I\_MPI\_DYNAMIC\_CONNECTION=0 -genv I\_MPI\_FABRICS=shm:dapl" -batch
    /mnt/resource/scratch/benchmark/runAndRecord.java
    /mnt/resource/scratch/benchmark/{filename.sim)
```
